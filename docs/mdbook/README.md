# DataFusion Book

This folder builds a DataFusion user guide using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## Build and run book locally

Build the latest files with `mdbook build`.

Open the book locally by running `open book/index.html`.

## Install mdBook

Download the `mdbook` binary or run `cargo install mdbook`.

Then manually open it, so you have permissions to run it on your Mac.

Add it to your path with a command like this so you can easily run the commands: `mv ~/Downloads/mdbook /Users/matthew.powers/.local/bin`.
